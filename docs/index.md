## About

General information I've gathered from Cyber Security research

## Installation

Install the Windmill Dark theme using `pip`:

``` sh
pip install mkdocs-windmill-dark
```

To install and get started with `mkdocs`, follow [MkDocs documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/#installation).

## Usage

To use the Windmill Dark theme installed via `pip`, add this to your `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
theme: 'windmill-dark'
```

If you cloned Windmill Dark from GitHub:

``` yaml
theme_dir: 'mkdocs-windmill-dark/mkdocs_windmill_dark'
```

See [Customization](customization.md) for a few extra configuration options
supported by the Windmill Dark theme.
